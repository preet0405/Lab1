This is a HTML and Javascript project for carrying out operations like insert delete and popping up a message when all rows are deleted. 
This code provides a table with five rows and two columns where I can insert, delete and add prompts.
I have used languages like html, javascript and css for styling the web page.
I have also used gemini and chatgpt for adding one function of inserting row in it.
I have added a popup alert for displaying the message that there are no more rows to delete.
